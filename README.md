Welcome to the Mass Mayhem Mod (or MMM for short)! This mod, written by BillyS, is an admin/trusted user only mod.  It consists of random nodes, some of which are useful, and some of which are destructive.
Here is a list of the items in MMM:

1) Liquid Nitrogen

Its cool, its cold, and it will stop you in your tracks! If you have BillyS's jail mod installed, this liquid will freeze any players who venture near it for too long.

2) Spawn Fluid

Instant spawn! With a single touch, this liquid will cause players to respawn.
